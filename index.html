          <h2>French Cousine</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Chicken confit</li>
            <p>
              In this classic confit, the chicken is salted and seasoned with
              herbs, then slowly cooked in olive oil to make it rich and tender.
            </p>
            <li>French onion soup</li>
            <p>
              See out the winter with this fragrant French onion soup. Donâ€™t
              forget the cheesy croutons.
            </p>
            <li>Bouillabaisse</li>
            <p>
              This traditional French fish soup is infused with saffron, orange,
              thyme and chilli.
            </p>
            <li>Salmon en papillote</li>
            <p>
              This clever technique of wrapping fish in paper before cooking
              ensures that all the moisture and flavours are locked in.
            </p>
            <li>Quiche Lorraine</li>
            <p>
              Originally quiche Lorraine was an open custard pie with smoked
              bacon. It is only the more modern versions that add cheese to the
              mix.

          <h2>Italian Cousine</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Panzenella</li>
            <p>
              Panzenella is a Tuscan bread salad, ideal for summer. It does not
              follow a particular recipe, but the two ingredients that do not
              change are tomatoes and bread.
            </p>
            <li>Bruschetta</li>
            <p>
              An antipasto dish, bruschetta has grilled bread topped with
              veggies, rubbed garlic and tomato mix. A country bread sliced and
              topped with different toppings - the evergreen tomato-basil and an
              inventive mushroom-garlic. The classic Italian starter!
            </p>
            <li>Focaccia Bread</li>
            <p>
              Fresh dough is topped with caramelized onions, olives, tomato
              slices, basil leaves, grated parmesan cheese and baked delicious!
            </p>

          <h2>Spanish Cousine</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Patatas bravas</li>
            <p>
              The potatoes are cubed and shallow fried and served the same
              everywhere. The sauce can come in any number of ways, from spicy
              ketchup to garlic mayonnaise with a dusting of pimiento (smoked
              paprika), or both.
            </p>
            <li>Gazpacho</li>
            <p>
              This tomato-based Andalusian soup is most famous for being served
              cold. This can be quite a shock for those who aren't expecting it,
              but in the searing heat of a Seville summer, the attraction
              becomes clear.
            </p>
            <li>Pimientos de Padron</li>
            <p>
              A common dish on tapas menus, pimientos de Padron are green
              peppers that hail originally from the town of that name in
              Galicia, in Spain's lush, rainy northwest.
